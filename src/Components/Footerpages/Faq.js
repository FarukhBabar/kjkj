          that date. If you are not there to receive as agreed, the costs of a failed attempt and second delivery will be passed directly to you by secondary invoice. Any specific delivery requests MUST be entered

        <b> <p>I would like to order in bulk quantities, can you arrange this for me and what is the procedure for special orders?</p></b>
        <p>Purchasing in high quantities can depend on product to product and is not always available. You will need to specify which products you are looking to bulk buy to enquiries@efghousewares.co.uk. We
          will then forward your bulk buy enquiry on to the right departments. Once the order is received we will require a 25% non- refundable deposit this will allow us to place the order on our suppliers the
          balance will be payable before delivery of the goods.</p>

        <b> <p>How do I know if a product is sold in a pack / case?</p></b>
        <p>On our website, where it says ‘PK’, it indicates that it is sold as a pack, followed by the quantity of units in the pack. For example, if a product shows ‘PK6’, it would mean that it is sold in a pack of 6.</p>
